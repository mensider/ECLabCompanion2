<h2 id="dos">DO’S</h2>
<p>Before starting the lab work ensure all instruments are working in good condition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch on the CRO and check for the traces for both channels.</li>
<li>Check all meters for errors and bend needles.</li>
<li>Check all diodes and transistors before connecting in the circuit.</li>
<li>Check all op-amps by setting up simple zero crossing detector circuit.</li>
<li>Be soft while inserting and removing ICs from the bread board.</li>
<li>While using digital ICs make sure that the supply voltage is exactly 5V.</li>
<li>Make sure that power is applied before applying input o any electronic circuit (where ever power supply is required).</li>
<li>Check the conditions of the circuits after setting up the circuit.</li>
<li>Switch off all Equipments and arrange your seats properly leaving the lab.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="donts">DON’TS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not switch off the CRO often.</li>
<li>Do not leave bits of wire in the bread board.</li>
<li>Do not short circuit the output terminals of the power supply.</li>
<li>Do not touch on the back side of the equipment unnecessarily.</li>
<li>While working with line supply do not touch the bread board or any other devices with the supply on.</li>
</ul>
